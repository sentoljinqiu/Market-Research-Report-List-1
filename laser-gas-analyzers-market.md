<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Gas Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The laser gas analyzers market is divided into two main types: in-situ and extractive analyzers. In-situ analyzers measure gas concentrations directly within the process environment, providing real-time data without interrupting operations. They are ideal for continuous monitoring. On the other hand, extractive analyzers take gas samples from the process for analysis in a separate chamber. This method allows for more detailed analysis but may involve additional equipment and potential delays. Both types are crucial for environmental monitoring and industrial applications.</p></p>

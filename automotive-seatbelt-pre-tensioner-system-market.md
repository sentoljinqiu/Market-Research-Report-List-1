<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seatbelt Pre-tensioner System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-tightening</li><li>Pre-roll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive seatbelt pre-tensioner system market is divided into two main types: pre-tightening and pre-roll. Pre-tightening systems activate in case of a collision, retracting excess slack from the seatbelt to secure the occupant firmly in place, minimizing movement and reducing injury risk. Pre-roll systems, on the other hand, are designed to slightly pull the seatbelt before a crash occurs, enhancing fit and comfort while preparing the occupant for a potential impact. Both systems enhance overall safety during vehicle operation.</p></p>
